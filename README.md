## My process üó∫Ô∏è

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

When doing this challenge I analyzed when I should or should not use a container. Because sometimes I wonder which elements would be easier to work with if they were combined into one.

Furthermore, there are times when I get lost with the names I give to the classes. I'm studying how to name them properly.
